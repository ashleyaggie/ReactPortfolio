## Description

Re-creating my portfolio, but using React and React Router. Getting the styles to work was a little confusing, but I managed to more or less get it to work.

I'd like to go back later and fix the issue with the footer not staying at the bottom, and maybe changing the header so it has something that conditionally renders.
